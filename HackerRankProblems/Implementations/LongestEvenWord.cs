    * of any other word in the sentence.For example, if sentence is Time to write great code,

    * if sentence is Write code for a great time, then the word we’re looking for is code because it’s 
    * the first word with maximal even length.

      Complete the function from the provided code. It has one parameter: a string, sentence.
      The function must return a string denoting the longest even length word in sentence.
      If there are two such words having the maximum even length, return the word that appears first in 
      sentence; if none of the words in sentence are even in length, return 00 instead.
